# vimconfig
My personal vimrc files

Currently there is only one vim config file which is designed to not need plugins. 
It is designed to work with exuberant-ctags.

You can install exuberant-ctags on debian with
sudo apt install exuberant-ctags

Also rename the config file should be name .vimrc. The path of the file should be $HOME/.vimrc

To get the color scheme to work:
Go to /usr/share/vim/vimXX/colors and copy gruvbox.vim into that directory.
