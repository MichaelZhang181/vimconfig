# vimconfig
My personal vimrc files

There is a file designed to work with the standard set of plugins installed with vim
It is designed to work with exuberant-ctags or universal.

There is also a version with vim-plugs. This may be updated for vim8 in the future

Use the vimconfig file by rename it to ".vimrc" and placing it in $HOME.
